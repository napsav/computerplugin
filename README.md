A Spigot Computer plugin

## What can you do with it?
At the moment, not much. Using writable books you can write simple commands such as ```PRINT "hello world"```. The interpreter will recognize the instructions and the strings.

## Crafting
Craft a computer like this:

|GLASS|GLASS|GLASS|
|STONE|REDSTONE|STONE|
|STONE|STONE|STONE|

Then you can use it by right-clicking. You can put a writable book with commands written in it, then you can close the inventory. When the inventory closes, your commands will be interpreted automatically.

## Future plans

I'm currently planning to add many more features, such as interaction with chests and furnaces, or other types of instructions. Any suggestions are welcome.
